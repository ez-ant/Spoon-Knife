## My project progress

I am not sure what are we supposed to do in the project. If it is similiar to a rcos project, I want to implement a calendar which would remain me things that need to be done in the following week. Creating this project would help me manage my time efficiently and I may adjust the software based on my needs. Since this is a small project, I only need a small team. I would let one people to implement the Ui and the other people to implement the functions. Since those two parts are separated, it should be easy to merge.
